next:
v13.9.21:
  - With the new Makefile, the binary names have changed. Instead of
    login-server, ladmin, etc., they are now tmwa-login, tmwa-admin, etc.
    (properly namespaced). Please remove any instances of the following
    files from your system: ladmin, login-server, char-server, map-server,
    eathena-monitor, deps.make
  - Fix statup2 not actually doing anything.
  - Add 'return' to the list of script commands that don't work properly
    inside an 'if' statement.
v13.9.12:
  - Also allow "true" and "false" as boolean values in config files.
  - The format of lan_support.conf has changed slightly.
    If you have made any adjustments, you MUST update it.
  - Increase maximum size of a script array from 128 to 256.
  - Fix scissors bug.
v13.8.28:
  - First release - finally cleaned up enough to feel good about.
