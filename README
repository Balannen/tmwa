COMPILING TMW-EATHENA

In addition to the basic build tools (GCC, Make, headers, ...), Bison, and
Flex are needed. On Debian derivates, do:

  sudo apt-get install build-essential flex bison

In addition, on 64-bit machines you need 32-bit compatibility headers. On
Debian derivatives you need to install libc6-dev-i386:

  sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386

If you're using make 3.81 instead of 3.82 (which isn't very unlikely), you
will have to run the following command before running 'make':

  mkdir -p obj/{common,login,char,map,ladmin,tool}

Finally, you're ready to run:

  make


SERVER DATA AND CONFIGURATION

This is just tmwAthena. We store our scripts, item and monster databases, etc.
in a separate git repository called tmw-eathena-data, available at:

 http://github.com/themanaworld/tmwa-server-data

Note that this repository contains more than just the contents of this data
directory. Either set up symbolic links or just copy the server executables
into it.
